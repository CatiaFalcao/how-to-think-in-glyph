# How to Think in GLYPH

**A neuroinclusive guide to structured problem thinking**  
*Part of the GLYPH ecosystem*

> **Intelligence starts with the right problem.**

## 📌 What is this repository?

This repository contains the official guide **“How to Think in GLYPH”** —  
a cognitive and methodological guide that teaches **how to formulate problems clearly**, before attempting to solve them.

This guide is:
- structured
- neuroinclusive
- system-agnostic
- solution-independent

It is designed for:
- professionals
- researchers
- students
- engineers
- strategists
- and neurodivergent thinkers

---

## 🧠 Why this guide exists

Across domains, most failures do not come from poor solutions —  
they come from **poorly formulated problems**.

Common issues include:
- confusing symptoms with causes
- mixing opinions with observations
- jumping prematurely to solutions
- discussing different problems using the same words

The **GLYPH language** was created to address this gap.

This guide explains **how to think using GLYPH**, step by step.

## 🧩 What is GLYPH?

**GLYPH** is a universal language for structured problem formulation.

It provides:
- a canonical structure for describing problems
- strict separation between observation, interpretation, and action
- a validation framework for problem clarity
- a foundation for reusable, comparable problem knowledge

GLYPH is **not** a solution framework.  
It is a **thinking framework**.

## 🔁 The GLYPH Thinking Cycle

1. **System + Context** — Where and under what conditions the problem exists  
2. **Symptom + Impact** — What happens and who/what is affected  
3. **Variables** — Elements involved, without assigning blame  
4. **Causal Chain** — How variables relate to produce the symptom  
5. **Leverage Point** — The single point of highest influence  
6. **Success Criteria** — How to verify improvement objectively

## ♿ Neuroinclusive by design

This guide was explicitly designed to support:
- autistic thinkers
- neurodivergent professionals
- people who struggle with ambiguity or unstructured discussions

Key principles:
- clear separation of concepts
- explicit rules
- reduced cognitive overload
- permission to think step by step

Neuroinclusion is not an add-on — it is part of the design.
